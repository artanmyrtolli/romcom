# Application Operating Instructions

Once you open up this application with the deployable link you can navigate as you see fit. The randomize cover button will display a new random set of elements for your potential RomCom cover. These elements include a cover photo, title, and two descriptors. If a cover that you enjoy is displayed you can save the cover with the "Save cover button". If the randoms covers don't suit your needs you can create your own with the "Make your own cover" button. Please fill out the input fields and submit them with the "make my book button". Once submitted it will return you to the home page where you can choose to save the book cover if you like it. Once covers have been saved they will be displayed in the view saved covers section. This can be accessed by the "view saved covers button". Once viewing the saved covers you can delete any that you dislike with a double click.
